## User command ##
``` {user_command} ```

------------

Your task is to parse the user's command into a JSON object. The JSON object should have the following keys:
- `action` (string): the type of action. The value can be `fetch`, `recall`, or `generic`. Use `generic` if the command is broadly related to the situation. (Example: if the user requests to summarize the interaction so far.)
- `object_name` (string): a short name of the object
- `detail` (string): the details of the object. This includes color, size, description of position, and so on.
- `relevancy` (boolean): if the command is relevant. The value can be `true` or `false`.

## Examples ##
Input: """Fetch me the banana"""
Ouptut: ```json\n{{"action":"fetch","object_name":"banana","detail":"","relevancy":true}}\n```

Input: """Where is the apple?"""
Output: ```json\n{{"action":"recall","object_name":"apple","detail":"","relevancy":true}}\n```

Input: """What did we do so far?"""
Output: ```json\n{{"action":"generic","object_name":"","detail":"What did we do so far?","relevancy":true}}\n```

------------

If the command is not relevant to fetching or observing, set `relevancy` to false. Output the JSON object below.
