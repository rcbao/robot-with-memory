## User Input ##
``` {user_command} ```

------------

Your task is to parse the user's input into a JSON object with the following keys:
- `relevancy` (boolean): if the command is relevant to the situation. The value can be `true` or `false`.
- `action` (string): the type of action. The value can be `fetch`, `recall`, or `generic`. If the input is broadly related to the situation (e.g., if requests for summarizing the interaction so far), set `action` to `generic`.
- `object_names` (list of strings): a list of short names of the objects (e.g., apple, Rubik's cube, softball, etc.) mentioned in the input.
- `detail` (string): details mentioned in the input. For `fetch` and `recall` inputs, this includes color, size, description of position, and so on. For generic user inputs, put the entire input in this field.

{{
    "relevancy": true,
    "action": "fetch",
    "object_names": ["banana"],
    "detail": ""
}}
```

Input: """Please give me the pitcher"""
Output: ```json

}}
```

Input: """Put the apple on the table"""
Output: ```json

```

Input: """Where are the bananas and apples?"""
Output: ```json

    "action": "generic",
    "object_names": [],
    "detail": "What did we do so far?"
}}
```

Input: """What objects did I ask you to fetch in this session?"""
Output: ```json

    "relevancy": true,
    "action": "generic",
    "object_names": [],
    "detail": "What objects did I ask you to fetch in this session?"
}}

Input: """Thanks!"""
Output: ```json

    "relevancy": true,
    "action": "generic",
