## User Input ##
``` {user_command} ```

------------

Your task is to parse the user's input into a JSON object with the following keys:
- `relevancy` (boolean): if the command is relevant to the situation. The value can be `true` or `false`.
- `action` (string): the type of action. The value can be `fetch`, `recall`, or `generic`. If the input is broadly related to the situation (e.g., if requests for summarizing the interaction so far), set `action` to `generic`.
- `object_name` (string): a short name of the object (e.g., apple, Rubik's cube, toy, etc) mentioned in the input.
- `detail` (string): details mentioned in the input. For `fetch` and `recall` inputs, this includes color, size, description of position, and so on. For generic user inputs, put the entire input in this field. 

## Examples ##
Input: """Fetch me the banana"""
Ouptut: ```json\n{{"action":"fetch","object_name":"banana","detail":"","relevancy":true}}\n```

Input: """Please give me the pitcher"""
Ouptut: ```json\n{{"action":"fetch","object_name":"rubiks_cube","detail":"","relevancy":true}}\n```

Input: """Put the apple on the table"""
Ouptut: ```json\n{{"action":"fetch","object_name":"apple","detail":"","relevancy":true}}\n```

Input: """Where is the banana?"""
Output: ```json\n{{"action":"recall","object_name":"banana","detail":"","relevancy":true}}\n```

Input: """What did we do so far?"""
Output: ```json\n{{"action":"generic","object_name":"","detail":"What did we do so far?","relevancy":true}}\n```

Input: """What objects did I ask you to fetch in this session?"""
Output: ```json\n{{"action":"generic","object_name":"","detail":"What objects did I ask you to fetch in this session?","relevancy":true}}\n```

If the command is not relevant to fetching or observing, set `relevancy` to false. Output the JSON object below.
