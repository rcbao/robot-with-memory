## User command ##
{user_command}
------
Your task is to parse the user's command into a JSON object. The JSON object should have the following keys:
- `action` (string): the type of action. The value can be `fetch`, `recall`, or `generic`. Use `generic` if the command is broadly related to the situation. (Example: if the user requests to summarize the interaction so far.)
- `object_name` (string): a short name of the object
- `detail` (string): the details of the object. This includes color, size, description of position, and so on.
- `relevancy` (boolean): if the command is relevant. The value can be `true` or `false`.

If the command is not relevant to fetching or observing, set `relevancy` to false. Output the JSON object below.
